#### **Lesson 6: Model Performance Monitoring and Management**

**Objective:**
In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to monitor and manage model performance over time. We'll cover techniques for tracking metrics, handling model drift, and implementing continuous monitoring.

---

#### **1. Model Performance Monitoring**

Effective monitoring involves tracking various metrics and logging information about model performance during and after deployment.

**a. Tracking Metrics:**

**1. In-Production Monitoring:**

- **Real-Time Metrics:** Monitor metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and latency in real-time.
- **Logging:** Use logging tools to capture model predictions, errors, and other relevant information.

**Example: Using TensorBoard for TensorFlow Models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

# Define TensorBoard callback
tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs')

# Train model with TensorBoard callback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

Access TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=./logs
```

**2. Custom Logging:**

- Use tools like Python's `logging` library to log predictions and errors.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='model_predictions.log', level=logging.INFO)

def log_prediction(input_data, prediction):
    logging.info(f'Input: {input_data}, Prediction: {prediction}')
```

**b. Model Drift Detection:**

Model drift occurs when the statistical properties of the target variable change over time, making the model less effective.

**1. Concept Drift Detection:**

- **Statistical Tests:** Use statistical tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov to detect changes in data distributions.

**Example: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**

```python
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

stat, p_value = ks_2samp(predicted_distribution, actual_distribution)
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Model drift detected")
```

**2. Performance Degradation:**

- **Monitor Performance Metrics:** Track model performance on a validation set and compare it over time.

**Example: Tracking Metrics Over Time**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example performance data
epochs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
accuracy = [0.8, 0.82, 0.83, 0.81, 0.80]

plt.plot(epochs, accuracy)
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy Over Time')
plt.show()
```

#### **2. Handling Model Drift**

**a. Retraining Models:**

Retraining models periodically or when significant drift is detected can help maintain performance.

**1. Retraining Strategy:**

- **Scheduled Retraining:** Set up a schedule to retrain models at regular intervals.
- **Trigger-Based Retraining:** Retrain models when performance metrics fall below a certain threshold.

**Example: Retraining Script**

```python
if model_performance < threshold:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)
    model.save('retrained_model.h5')
```

**b. Data Versioning:**

**1. Track Data Versions:**

- **Version Control Systems:** Use version control systems to manage and track different versions of training data.

**Example: Data Versioning with DVC**

```bash
dvc init
dvc add data/train_data.csv
dvc push
```

**2. Data Drift Detection:**

- **Monitor Data Distribution:** Track changes in data distributions and detect anomalies.

---

#### **3. Continuous Monitoring and Management**

**a. Monitoring Infrastructure:**

**1. Monitoring Tools:**

- **Prometheus & Grafana:** Use Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Use ELK stack for log management and analysis.

**Example: Configuring Prometheus**

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "model_metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:8000"]
```

**b. Implementing Alerts:**

**1. Set Up Alerts:**

- **Alerting Tools:** Use tools like Prometheus Alertmanager or custom scripts to trigger alerts based on performance metrics.

**Example: Setting Up Alerts with Prometheus Alertmanager**

```yaml
# alertmanager.yml
route:
  receiver: "email"
receivers:
  - name: "email"
    email_configs:
      - to: "your_email@example.com"
```

**2. Automated Responses:**

- **Auto-Scaling and Retraining:** Implement auto-scaling and automated retraining based on performance metrics and alerts.

---

#### **4. Hands-On Exercise**

**Task:** Implement model monitoring and drift detection for a deployed model.

1. **Set Up TensorBoard Logging:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

2. **Implement Custom Logging:**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='model_predictions.log', level=logging.INFO)

def log_prediction(input_data, prediction):
    logging.info(f'Input: {input_data}, Prediction: {prediction}')
```

3. **Detect Model Drift:**

```python
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

stat, p_value = ks_2samp(predicted_distribution, actual_distribution)
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Model drift detected")
```

4. **Set Up Alerts:**

- Configure Prometheus and Alertmanager to monitor metrics and send alerts.
