     model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')
     feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor()

     # Prepare an image
     from PIL import Image
     image = Image.open('image.jpg')
     inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

     # Perform inference
