### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science**

#### **Objectives:**

1. Understand what data science is and its importance.
2. Learn about the data science workflow.
3. Get familiar with basic tools and libraries.

#### **1. What is Data Science?**

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Data Analysis:** Process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data.
- **Machine Learning:** A subset of data science focused on building models that learn from data and make predictions.
- **Big Data:** Handling and processing large volumes of data that traditional data processing tools canâ€™t handle efficiently.

#### **2. The Data Science Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering raw data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using statistical graphics and other methods to understand the data.
4. **Modeling:** Building and training models to make predictions or identify patterns.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and validating results.
6. **Deployment:** Implementing the model in a production environment and making it accessible for use.
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Continuously evaluating model performance and updating it as needed.

#### **3. Basic Tools and Libraries**

- **Python:** A versatile programming language widely used in data science.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive computing environment for writing and executing code.
- **Pandas:** A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing in Python.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.

#### **4. Getting Started with Python**

**Installation:**

- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install Jupyter Notebook using `pip install notebook`.

**Code Example:**

```python
# Importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display DataFrame
print(df)

# Basic statistics
print(df.describe())

# Plotting
df['Age'].plot(kind='bar')
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age of Individuals')
plt.show()
```

#### **5. Key Takeaways**

- Data science involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions.
- The workflow is iterative and may require revisiting previous steps.
- Python and its libraries are essential tools for data science.

#### **6. Homework/Practice:**

- Install Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the necessary libraries.
- Create a simple DataFrame using Pandas and perform basic data exploration.
- Experiment with different plots using Matplotlib.
