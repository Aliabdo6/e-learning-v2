### Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)

---

#### Overview

In this lesson, we will explore Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). HRL addresses the challenge of learning complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. This hierarchical approach can improve learning efficiency and policy generalization. We will discuss key concepts, algorithms, and implement a basic HRL example.

#### 1. Introduction to Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

**Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)** involves structuring the learning process into multiple levels, where higher-level policies define goals or sub-tasks, and lower-level policies handle the execution of these sub-tasks.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Hierarchy of Policies:** HRL introduces a hierarchy where high-level policies select sub-tasks or goals, and low-level policies execute these tasks.
- **Options Framework:** A common HRL framework where an option consists of a policy, a termination condition, and a value function.
- **Macro-Actions:** Higher-level actions that are sequences of lower-level actions.

**Advantages:**

- **Scalability:** Simplifies the learning problem by breaking it into smaller sub-tasks.
- **Reusability:** Allows the reuse of learned policies for different tasks.
- **Faster Learning:** Focuses learning on sub-tasks, potentially speeding up the training process.

**Challenges:**

- **Complexity:** Designing and managing hierarchical structures can be complex.
- **Coordination:** Ensuring proper coordination between different levels of the hierarchy.

#### 2. Key Algorithms in HRL

**a. Options Framework:**
The Options Framework introduces the concept of options, which are temporal abstractions that consist of:

- **Policy:** The action-selection strategy.
- **Termination Condition:** Determines when the option should terminate.
- **Value Function:** Evaluates the option's performance.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialize** options and their policies.
2. **For each episode:**
   1. Choose an option using the high-level policy.
   2. Execute the option's policy until the termination condition is met.
   3. Update the high-level and low-level policies.

**b. Hierarchical DQN (h-DQN):**
An extension of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) that uses a hierarchy of Q-networks for handling different levels of abstraction.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialize** high-level and low-level Q-networks.
2. **For each episode:**
   1. Choose a high-level action (sub-task) using the high-level Q-network.
   2. Execute the sub-task using the low-level Q-network.
   3. Update both high-level and low-level Q-networks based on the received rewards.

#### 3. Python Implementation: Basic HRL with Options Framework

**Step 1: Define the Environment**

We will use a simple grid world environment where the agent can perform macro-actions (e.g., "move to a specific goal").

```python
import numpy as np
import gym
from gym import spaces

class GridWorldEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GridWorldEnv, self).__init__()
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(4)  # Actions: 0: Left, 1: Down, 2: Right, 3: Up
        self.observation_space = spaces.MultiDiscrete([4, 4])  # 4x4 grid
        self.state = [0, 0]  # Initial state

    def reset(self):
        self.state = [0, 0]
        return np.array(self.state)

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0:  # Left
            self.state[0] = max(0, self.state[0] - 1)
        elif action == 1:  # Down
            self.state[1] = max(0, self.state[1] - 1)
        elif action == 2:  # Right
            self.state[0] = min(3, self.state[0] + 1)
        elif action == 3:  # Up
            self.state[1] = min(3, self.state[1] + 1)

        reward = 1 if self.state == [3, 3] else 0
        done = reward == 1
        return np.array(self.state), reward, done, {}

    def render(self, mode='human'):
        grid = np.zeros((4, 4))
        grid[tuple(self.state)] = 1
        print(grid)

env = GridWorldEnv()
```

**Step 2: Implement Basic HRL with Options**

We'll implement a simple HRL setup with a high-level policy selecting goals and a low-level policy achieving those goals.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

class HighLevelPolicy:
    def __init__(self, n_goals, n_actions):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((n_goals, n_actions))
        self.alpha = 0.1
        self.gamma = 0.99
        self.epsilon = 0.1
        self.n_goals = n_goals
        self.n_actions = n_actions

    def choose_goal(self, state):
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])

    def update(self, state, goal, reward, next_goal):
        best_next_goal = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_goal])
        td_target = reward + self.gamma * self.q_table[next_goal, best_next_goal]
        td_error = td_target - self.q_table[state, goal]
        self.q_table[state, goal] += self.alpha * td_error

class LowLevelPolicy:
    def __init__(self, n_actions, n_states, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=0.1):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.epsilon = epsilon

    def choose_action(self, state):
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.epsilon:
            return random.choice(range(env.action_space.n))
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])

    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        best_next_action = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_state])
        td_target = reward + self.gamma * self.q_table[next_state, best_next_action]
        td_error = td_target - self.q_table[state, action]
        self.q_table[state, action] += self.alpha * td_error

# Initialize policies
high_level_policy = HighLevelPolicy(n_goals=4, n_actions=4)
low_level_policy = LowLevelPolicy(n_actions=4, n_states=16)

num_episodes = 1000
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    goal = high_level_policy.choose_goal(state[0] * 4 + state[1])
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = low_level_policy.choose_action(state[0] * 4 + state[1])
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        low_level_policy.update(state[0] * 4 + state[1], action, reward, next_state[0] * 4 + next_state[1])

        if done:
            high_level_policy.update(state[0] * 4 + state[1], goal, reward, next_state[0] * 4 + next_state[1])

        state = next_state

env.close()
```

#### 4. Summary and Next Steps

In this lesson, we covered Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), including the concepts of hierarchical policies, the Options Framework, and hierarchical algorithms. We implemented a basic HRL setup using the Options Framework with a grid world environment. In the next lesson, we will explore Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning, which involves leveraging knowledge from one task to improve learning in another.
