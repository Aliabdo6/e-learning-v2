### Value-Based Methods in Reinforcement Learning

#### Overview

In this lesson, we will focus on Value-Based Methods in Reinforcement Learning (RL). These methods involve estimating the value of states or actions to guide the agent's decision-making. We will cover key algorithms like Q-Learning and SARSA, delve into their mechanics, and implement them in code.

#### 1. Understanding Value-Based Methods

Value-Based Methods aim to find the optimal policy by estimating the value functions associated with states or state-action pairs. These methods are grounded in the concept that an agent should choose actions that lead to states with higher expected rewards.

**Key Concepts:**

- **State Value Function (V(s)):** Estimates the expected return (reward) starting from state `s` and following a specific policy.
- **Action Value Function (Q(s, a)):** Estimates the expected return of taking action `a` in state `s` and then following a specific policy.

**Objective:**
The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. This is achieved by learning the optimal value functions.

#### 2. Q-Learning

**Q-Learning** is an off-policy algorithm that learns the value of actions in states. It updates the Q-values (action-value function) based on the Bellman equation.

**Bellman Equation for Q-Learning:**
\[ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] \]
Where:

- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
- \( r \) is the reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
- \( \max\_{a'} Q(s', a') \) is the maximum Q-value for the next state \( s' \).

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize Q-values arbitrarily.
2. For each episode:
   1. Initialize state \( s \).
   2. For each step of the episode:
      1. Choose an action \( a \) using an exploration strategy (e.g., Îµ-greedy).
      2. Take action \( a \), observe reward \( r \) and next state \( s' \).
      3. Update Q-value using the Bellman equation.
      4. Set state \( s \) to \( s' \).

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

# Initialize parameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate
num_episodes = 1000

# Initialize environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
n_actions = env.action_space.n
n_states = np.prod(env.observation_space.shape)

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

def get_discrete_state(state):
    # Discretize state space for simplicity
    return np.digitize(state, bins=np.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, num=20))

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = get_discrete_state(env.reset())
    done = False

    while not done:
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()  # Explore
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])  # Exploit

        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_state = get_discrete_state(next_state)

        # Q-learning update
        Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])
        state = next_state

env.close()
```

---

#### 3. SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)

**SARSA** is an on-policy algorithm that updates the Q-values based on the action taken by the agent.

**Bellman Equation for SARSA:**
\[ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] \]
Where:

- \( s' \) is the next state.
- \( a' \) is the next action taken in state \( s' \).

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize Q-values arbitrarily.
2. For each episode:
   1. Initialize state \( s \) and choose action \( a \) using an exploration strategy.
   2. For each step of the episode:
      1. Take action \( a \), observe reward \( r \) and next state \( s' \).
      2. Choose next action \( a' \) using the same strategy.
      3. Update Q-value using the Bellman equation for SARSA.
      4. Set state \( s \) to \( s' \) and action \( a \) to \( a' \).

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

# Initialize parameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate
num_episodes = 1000

# Initialize environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
n_actions = env.action_space.n
n_states = np.prod(env.observation_space.shape)

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

def get_discrete_state(state):
    # Discretize state space for simplicity
    return np.digitize(state, bins=np.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, num=20))

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = get_discrete_state(env.reset())
    action = env.action_space.sample() if np.random.rand() < epsilon else np.argmax(Q[state, :])
    done = False

    while not done:
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_state = get_discrete_state(next_state)
        next_action = env.action_space.sample() if np.random.rand() < epsilon else np.argmax(Q[next_state, :])

        # SARSA update
        Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[next_state, next_action] - Q[state, action])
        state = next_state
        action = next_action

env.close()
```
