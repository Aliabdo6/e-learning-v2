### Lesson 6: Text Generation Techniques and Applications

#### Objectives:

- Understand the concept and applications of text generation.
- Learn about different text generation techniques.
- Implement basic text generation using language models and frameworks.

#### 6.1 Introduction to Text Generation

Text generation involves creating coherent and contextually relevant text from a given input. It is used in applications such as chatbots, automated content creation, and story generation.

**Common Applications:**

- **Chatbots:** Generate responses to user inputs.
- **Content Creation:** Generate articles, summaries, and creative writing.
- **Story Generation:** Create narratives or dialogues in creative writing.

#### 6.2 Text Generation Techniques

**6.2.1 Rule-Based Methods:**
Simple approaches using predefined templates and rules.

**6.2.2 Statistical Methods:**
Generate text based on statistical patterns learned from data (e.g., n-grams).

**6.2.3 Neural Network-Based Methods:**
Use deep learning models to generate text based on learned patterns from large corpora.

#### 6.3 Implementing Text Generation

**6.3.1 Using Markov Chains:**

Markov Chains are a statistical model used for generating sequences based on the probability of transitioning from one state to another.

```python
import random

# Sample text and bigrams
text = "I love machine learning. Machine learning is fun. I enjoy learning new things."
words = text.split()
bigrams = [(words[i], words[i+1]) for i in range(len(words)-1)]

# Build bigram model
bigram_model = {}
for w1, w2 in bigrams:
    if w1 not in bigram_model:
        bigram_model[w1] = []
    bigram_model[w1].append(w2)

# Generate text
def generate_text(start_word, length=10):
    current_word = start_word
    result = [current_word]
    for _ in range(length - 1):
        if current_word in bigram_model:
            current_word = random.choice(bigram_model[current_word])
        else:
            break
        result.append(current_word)
    return ' '.join(result)

print(generate_text("I", 10))
```

**6.3.2 Using GPT-3 for Text Generation:**

GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

**6.3.2.1 Installing OpenAI's API:**

```bash
pip install openai
```

**6.3.2.2 Using GPT-3 for Text Generation:**

```python
import openai

# Set your API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Generate text
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Once upon a time,",
  max_tokens=50
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

**6.3.3 Using Hugging Face's Transformers:**

Hugging Face provides easy access to various pre-trained language models for text generation.

**6.3.3.1 Installing Transformers Library:**

```bash
pip install transformers
```

**6.3.3.2 Using Transformers for Text Generation:**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load text generation pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Generate text
text = generator("Once upon a time, ", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
print(text[0]['generated_text'])
```

#### 6.4 Fine-Tuning Language Models for Custom Text Generation

Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to your specific domain or style.

**6.4.1 Preparing Data:**
Collect and preprocess a dataset relevant to your domain or style.

**6.4.2 Fine-Tuning with Transformers:**

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Prepare dataset
train_texts = ["Your training data here"]
train_encodings = tokenizer(train_texts, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)

# Define dataset class
class CustomDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings):
        self.encodings = encodings

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
        return item

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.encodings.input_ids)

train_dataset = CustomDataset(train_encodings)

# Define training arguments and trainer
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()

# Save the model
model.save_pretrained('./fine-tuned-gpt2')
```
