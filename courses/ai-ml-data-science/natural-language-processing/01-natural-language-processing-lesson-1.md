### Lesson 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

#### Objectives:

- Understand what NLP is and its importance.
- Learn about the different applications of NLP.
- Get introduced to basic NLP concepts and terminologies.
- Set up the environment for NLP development.

#### 1.1 What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

**Applications of NLP:**

- **Text Classification:** Categorizing text into predefined categories (e.g., spam detection in emails).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying entities in text (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations).
- **Machine Translation:** Automatically translating text from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).
- **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language into text (e.g., voice assistants).
- **Text Generation:** Producing coherent and contextually relevant text (e.g., chatbots, content creation).

#### 1.2 Basic Concepts and Terminology

**1.2.1 Tokenization:**
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. For example, the sentence "NLP is fun!" can be tokenized into ["NLP", "is", "fun", "!"].

**1.2.2 Stop Words:**
Stop words are common words that are usually removed from text during preprocessing because they do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "is", "the", "and").

**1.2.3 Stemming and Lemmatization:**

- **Stemming:** Reduces words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
- **Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their base form using a vocabulary and morphological analysis (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

**1.2.4 Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:**
POS tagging involves identifying the grammatical category of each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

**1.2.5 Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
NER involves identifying and classifying proper nouns in text, such as names of people, organizations, and locations.

**1.2.6 Bag of Words (BoW):**
BoW is a representation of text where each document is represented as a collection of words and their frequencies, ignoring grammar and word order.

**1.2.7 Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):**
TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).

#### 1.3 Setting Up the Environment

To start working on NLP tasks, you'll need to set up your development environment. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using Python:

**1.3.1 Install Python:**
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**1.3.2 Install Required Libraries:**
We'll use popular NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and SpaCy. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy
```

**1.3.3 Download NLTK Data:**
NLTK provides various datasets and models. Download the required data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Tokenization
nltk.download('stopwords')  # Stop words
```

**1.3.4 Download SpaCy Models:**
SpaCy requires language models. Download the English model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**1.3.5 Basic Code Examples:**

**Tokenization with NLTK:**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing is fascinating!"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

**Stop Words Removal with NLTK:**

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_tokens)
```

**POS Tagging with NLTK:**

```python
from nltk import pos_tag

pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)
print(pos_tags)
```

**Named Entity Recognition with SpaCy:**

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion.")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

#### 1.4 Summary and Next Steps

In this lesson, we covered the basics of NLP, including key concepts and terminology. We also set up the environment and ran some basic code examples.

**Next Steps:**

- In Lesson 2, we will dive deeper into text preprocessing techniques, including more advanced tokenization, text cleaning, and feature extraction methods.
